# Interactive To-Do List

## Description

This is a simple and interactive to-do list application. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application uses local storage to save tasks, so the list persists even after the page is refreshed. The user can also toggle between light and dark themes.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Input a new task and add it to the list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Click the edit button to modify the task text directly.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list using the delete button.
- **Toggle Completion:** Click on a task to mark it as done or not done.
- **Theme Toggle:** Switch between light and dark modes.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
